# Shared lock primitives so concurrent agents cannot corrupt each other's work.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Every agent in this repo shares ONE working tree, so these resources are
# genuinely single-tenant even though nothing enforces that:
#
#   build/ + .gradle/     Two `gradlew test` runs clobber each other's
#                         build/test-results/*.xml. The "N tests green"
#                         baseline quoted in AGENTS.md, KNOWN_ISSUES.md and
#                         docs/CHANGELOG.md is read out of those XMLs, so a
#                         clobber silently invalidates it.
#   NT4 5810 / WebServer
#   5800 / CameraServer
#   1181-1182            Hardcoded constants with no env override (verified
#                         against wpilibj 2026.2.1; CameraServer binds 1181-1182,
#                         NT listens on 1735/5810). One GUI sim, max.
#
# The old recovery advice ("kill stray java processes") was itself the
# interrupt: it cannot distinguish a leaked JVM from another agent's live test
# run or SimGUI. This module stops the contention instead of cleaning it up
# afterwards.
#
# DESIGN NOTES
# ------------
# * PowerShell 5.1 only: no ternaries, no -Parallel, no Start-ThreadJob.
# * Mutual exclusion is an exclusive file create, not a mutex: it is
#   inspectable with Get-Content, survives across shells, and does not need a
#   kernel object name that would collide with a stale kernel namespace.
# * Liveness is anchored on PID *plus* process start time. A bare PID is not
#   enough -- Windows recycles PIDs, and a dead sim whose PID got reassigned to
#   an unrelated process would look alive forever and deadlock the lock.
# * Liveness is "ANY anchor PID alive", because the caller may be a launcher
#   that exits while the work it started keeps running. Callers pass the PID of
#   the thing they actually care about via -AnchorPid.
# * Stale locks are reaped, because agents die mid-task. A lock that outlives
#   its owner is worse than no lock.

      .SYNOPSIS
        Returns the Elastic / AdvantageScope / SimGUI processes that are up.
      .DESCRIPTION
        A live dashboard is not a port problem, it is a data problem: WPILib
        opens the NT4 server before robot code runs, so any dashboard on the
        machine auto-connects to every sim worker and shares the robot's whole
        NT namespace, including the Auto Mission chooser. A GUI sim alongside
        headless measurements is silent contamination. This is the single
        definition; future rig tooling must call it rather than repeating the
        pattern, so the rule cannot drift between tools.
